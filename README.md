const image = new PixMix('source.jpg');
await image.addImage({ image: 'overlay.png', top: 30, left: 50 });
image.addText({
    text: 'Sample Text Here',
    ttf: 'path/to/font.ttf',
    size: 24,
    color: 'white',
    x: 100,

## üìö API

### `new PixMix(sourceImagePath)`
Creates a new instance of the PixMix class for image manipulation.
- **Parameters:**
  - `sourceImagePath` (string): Path to the source image file that will serve as the base for further editing.

### `addText(options)`
Adds text to the image using SVG format. The method adjusts the text's properties and positions it on the image according to the specified options.
- **Parameters:**
  - `options` (object): Configuration for adding text. The object includes:
    - `text` (string): The text content to add to the image.
    - `ttf` (string): Path to the TrueType font file (.ttf) used for rendering the text.
    - `size` (number): Font size for the text.
    - `color` (string): Color of the text, specified in any CSS color format (e.g., hex, rgba).
    - `x` (number): The x-coordinate (horizontal position) for the text's starting point on the image.
    - `y` (number): The y-coordinate (vertical position) for the text's starting point on the image.
    - `anchor` (string, optional): Text anchor position (e.g., 'top left', 'middle', 'bottom right'), defaults to 'top left'.
    - `letterSpacing` (number, optional): Space between the characters, defaults to 0.
    - `lineHeight` (number, optional): Line height expressed as a multiplier of the font size, defaults to 1.2.
- **Returns:** Adds a text overlay to the image composition queue.

### `addImage(options)`
Adds another image as a layer on top of the base image.
- **Parameters:**
  - `options` (object): Configuration for adding an overlay image. The object includes:
    - `image` (string): Path to the image file or a Buffer containing image data.
    - `top` (number): The top position (y-coordinate) where the overlay image will be placed on the base image.
    - `left` (number): The left position (x-coordinate) where the overlay image will be placed on the base image.
- **Returns:** Adds an image overlay to the image composition queue.

### `toFile(outputImagePath)`
Saves the composited image to a file.
- **Parameters:**
  - `outputImagePath` (string): The path where the final composited image will be saved.
- **Returns:** Asynchronously saves the composited image to a file. This method returns a Promise that resolves when the file has been written.

### `toBuffer()`
Generates a Buffer of the composited image, suitable for use when images need to be used directly in memory rather than saved to disk.
- **Returns:** Asynchronously returns a Buffer of the composited image. This method returns a Promise that resolves with the Buffer.
